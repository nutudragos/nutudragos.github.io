## Preparation
Mike Meyers All in One book and his Udemy course are great preparation. It covers all knowledge areas and a tad more everywhere.
Did lots of exam questions from various sources, including Jason Dion exam questions which I disected to understand every question and answer even if I already had the answer. These were harder than the exam but gave a sense of confidence in preparation.

## The good
Exam is straightforward, simple questions, with occasional attention traps. PBQ's are simpler than real life. This is really not an exam that tries to make you fail. All knowledge areas get tested.

## The bad
Nothing much here
