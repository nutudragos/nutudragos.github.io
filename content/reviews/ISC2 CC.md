## Preparation
Took their free self paced course which I finished in one week then took the exam.

## The good
It's free and some employers do value it (arguably little). Covers surface level cybersecurity and networking topics and the course platform is machanically nice (you get flashcards, videos, quizzes, etc.), while the content feels repetitive and boring.

This is the most entry level cybersecurity certificate I can recommend since it's free and ISC2 is quite reputable. 

## The bad
The content is really foundamental however the questions may query things not present in the course and they are formulated in ISC fashion so one may fail even if they prepared 100% for the material.

I would not have taken it unless it were free.
