## The good
Cert is hands on practical.

## The bad
Restricted web attack machine with no internet access and broken tools.
Exam expects you to only use some features of crackmapexec. Doing things a different way is punished by tools being blatantly broken. In my environment win-rm didn't exist at all - these barriers also help you not go down rabbit holes.

Course is half decent. Lots of extra content that isn't needed for the exam while also lacking depth on the things that actually come up on the exam.

The exam questions and letter of engagement are sometimes unrelated to the exam environment giving you false leads.

Feels incomplete.
